# Name

sweeeeep

why the name sweeeeep? because an elite-c is required to support the extra features, and an elite-c has 5 additional pins... so 5 Es for the 5 extra pins. Yes, it's dumb, I know.

# Descripiton

This is a reversible sweep pcb with support for 36 keys, per key leds, oled, and choc switches (no hotswap). In order to continue to support a no diode setup, I added support for the elite-c, and this is now required for the build.

# Support me!

I have spent a lot of time and money designing prototypes, testing, developing, etc. Any contributions would be greatly appreciated!

If you don't want to, or can't afford to support me, please send me a message to let me know you've built one, along with pictures. Also, feel free to submit a pull request with pictures into this repository. I'd be happy to showcase your build.
